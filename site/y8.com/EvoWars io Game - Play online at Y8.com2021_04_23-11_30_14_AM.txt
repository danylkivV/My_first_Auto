EvoWars.io is a fun multiplayer action .io game. You will start your character as a mere caveman and every time you level up, your character will evolve and your weapons and skills will also improve. You can level up by collecting the energy spheres or by killing another player. In this game it doesn’t matter how big your opponent is but it’s all about how fast you hack them with your weapon. But remember, the bigger the opponent the larger the area of their attack so be very cautious in being near to them. If ever you find yourself being close to any of the intimidating players you can always use the speed boost to dash you out the place but every time you use that skill, it deducts your current xp, so better use it wisely! There are 25 levels and evolutions to unlock. So Play EvoWars.io - Fight! Kill! Evolve!
